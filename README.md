A small program for kids who want to play with mouse.

##Description
This personnal project is first made to allow my younger boy to play with a mouse and improve his eye-hand coordination.

The program opens a white window and make random color blocks pop-up at a random position and move them to a random direction.
It also displays two counters, for the score and the timer. When the user clicks on a block the score is increased, a new block pops up with a new position, direction, and color.

##Improvements

It is the first version of this small game, which is going to be improved this way:
* A colored border will be displayed
* Many blocks will pop up every 5 seconds in different colors and the user will have to click on the right block 
to increase his score before a timelapse.
* A menu and different difficulties options will be created. If I have time to do it ;)

Please feel free to suggest any improvements.
