# ClickColor

A small program for kids who want to play with mouse, code in C(+ SDL and TTF libs)


The program open a white window and make blocks pop in a random color, at a random position and move it on a random direction.
It also displays two counters, for the score and timer. When the user click on a block, score is increase, a new block pop up, 
in a new position, direction, and color.

It is the first version of this small game, witch will be improve this way:
a colored border screen will be displayed and many blocks will pop up each 5 seconds in different colors and the user will have to click on the right block 
to increase his score before a timelapse.

Then, a menu and different difficulties options will be create. If I have time to do ;)

It's a personnal project, first made to allow my younger boy to play with moue and improve his "eye-hand coordination"
Thanks for reading this and for the improvement you could suggest.
